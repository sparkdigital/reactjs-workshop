# Spark Digital React JS workshop

## Purposed exercises:

1 Build the needed components in order to render a static movies list. (Using just a state on the component. No redux or store needed).

2 Create a simple form in order to edit a movie. It would be rendered on the /edit/:id path (Route is already set on this repo).

3 Create needed actions and the first reducer in order to make the form changes reflect in the application state. Form should not send any data yet.

4 Incorporate a new (async) action in order to fire initial GET request to the API in order to make the movies list dynamic on application load. Store the results in app state.

5 Make the neccessary changes to display these dynamic movies instead the harcoded ones on exercise 1. (Redux provider).

6 Add a new edit button for each movie displayed on the list. A new action should be created in order to load the selected movie data on the edit form.

7 Create a new async action in order to fire a POST request to the api and save the data in the form fields.

8 After that action, redirect to the home movies list and perform an update.

9 All Done!
